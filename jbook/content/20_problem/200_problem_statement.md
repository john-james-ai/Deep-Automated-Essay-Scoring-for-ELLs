# Problem Statement
Writing is a foundational skill. Sadly, it's one few students are able to hone, often because writing tasks are infrequently assigned in school. Students learning English as a second language, known as English Language Learners (ELLs), comprise 10.4 percent or 5.1 million public school students as of Fall of 2019 {cite}`geneseeEnglishLanguageLearners2005`, are especially affected by the lack of practice. While automated feedback tools make it easier for teachers to assign more writing tasks, they are not designed with ELLs in mind.

Both the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) have issued position statements urging recognition and accommodation of the diverse cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and learning needs of ELLs in English/Language Arts/Composition courses. Any discussion of automated scoring of writing in the US context, whether at the K-12 or postsecondary level, must therefore take into account the characteristics of ELL writers and their language proficiency so that assessments are fair and unbiased {cite}`weigleEnglishLanguageLearners2013`. Sensitizing automated feedback tools for ELLs to language proficiency could serve teachers by alleviating the grading burden and support ELLs by ensuring their work is evaluated within the context of their current language level {cite}`FeedbackPrizeEnglish`.

## Automated Essay Scoring for English Language Learners
The ELLIPSE corpus comprises argumentative essays written by 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures:
1. Cohesion: Grammatical and lexical linking within a text or sentence that holds a text together and gives it meaning {cite}`CohesionLinguistics2022`.
2. Syntax: Combining words and morhemes to form larger units such as phrases and sentences {cite}`Syntax2022`.
3. Vocabulary: Word selection and lexical diversity.
4. Phraseology: Set or fixed expressions, such as idioms, phrasal verbs, and other types of multi-word lexical units, in which the component parts of the expression take on a meaning more specific than, or otherwise not predictable from, the sum of their meanings when used independently {cite}`Phraseology2021`.
5. Grammar: The set of structural constraints on the writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words {cite}`Grammar2022`.
6. Conventions: Principles or norms that have been adopted by a linguistic community about how to use, and therefore what the meaning is of, specific terms {cite}`robinsonKnowingLinguisticConventions2014`.
